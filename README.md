## About the project
Support My Day was founded as a study company in September 2018.
Our goal is to improve the festival experience. For example, by using interactive maps full of information
for both visitors and organizations. That is why we are developing a mobile application
that can be used by festival visitors. It contains the functionalities: 
Find your friends on the festival site. 
Locations and waiting times of facilities such as access, stages, artists, food, drinks, toilet blocks.
Payment function, the "wallet", which uses NFC.

An optimal experience for festival visitors has become an important means 
for organizations to remain competitive in the changing market. We can monitor this
by making user information from the application available so that the organizer is aware of
the situation on the ground.
